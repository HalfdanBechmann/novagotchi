# Novagotchi
Software for the Novagotchi, an embedded project using an EFM32 Tiny Gecko microcontroller to make small pet-the-dog game.
Feature creep has made this project a wrist watch with a two year battery life with accurate timekeeping (LF crystal) and the screen on.
PCB schematics (and more pictures) available at https://circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/Halfdan-Bechmann/NovaGotchi.

A custom display driver and implementation of basic rendering tools are also implemented in this repo.
